Aim: To develop a multi-threaded solution to find a list of perfect numbers.


1. Enter the directory using the following command: <br />
    ```
    cd <previousDirectories>/Assgn1-AI20BTECH11021
    ```
2. The folder consists of an input file named `input.txt`, which consists of N, 
the number till which we check, and K, the number of threads, in that order respectively.
N and K can be adjusted manually.

3. Make sure there are no output files present from the previous run. 
This can be ensured by running the following command: <br />
    ```
    rm Out*
    ```

4. Ensure the previous executable file is also deleted using the following command: <br />
    ```
    rm *.out
    ```

5. Compile the program using the following command: <br />
    ```
    gcc Assgn1Src-AI20BTECH11021.c -o code.out
    ```

6. Run the executable File using:
    ```
    ./code.out
    ```
