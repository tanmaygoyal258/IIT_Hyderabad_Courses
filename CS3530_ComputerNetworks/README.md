# CS3530-ComputerNetworks

This repository contains all the assignments done as a part of the CS3530-ComputerNetworks Course offered at IIT Hyderabad in the semester of July-December'22.

It consists of implementing basic HHTP servers, with and without a cache, and simple protocols such as the Reliable Data Transfer Protocol(RDT), in two forms, Stop-And-Wait, and Go-Back-N. Both of these were implemented within a P4-BMV2-Mininet VM Setup.
