# CS6160- Cryptology

This repository contains all the assignments done as a part of the CS6160 Cryptology Course offered at IIT Hyderabad in the semester of July-December'23. 

Assignment 1 involves showing that multi-time pad is insecure and given streamcipher texts, we could decipher the texts using guesses as well as pair-wise operations.

Assignment 2 involves Brute-Force attack on the AES encryption scheme, and then carrying out a Meet-in-the-Middle attack on a scheme which involves encrypting twice using two keys.
