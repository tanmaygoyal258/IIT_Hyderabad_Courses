Aim: To develop a multi-threaded program to caluclate the value of i using the Monte-Carlo technique.


1. Enter the directory using the following command: <br />
    ```
    cd <previousDirectories>/Asgn1_AI20BTECH11021
    ```
2. The folder consists of an input file named `input.txt`, which consists of the number of random points to be generated, and the number of threads, in that order respectively.
Both of these can be adjusted manually.

3. Make sure the previous output file is not present. 
This can be ensured by running the following command: <br />
    ```
    rm out*
    ```

4. Ensure the previous executable file is also deleted using the following command: <br />
    ```
    rm *.out
    ```

5. Compile the program using the following command: <br />
    ```
    g++ -std=c++11 Asgn1Src-AI20BTECH11021.cpp -o code.out

    ```

6. Run the executable File using:
    ```
    ./code.out
    ```
