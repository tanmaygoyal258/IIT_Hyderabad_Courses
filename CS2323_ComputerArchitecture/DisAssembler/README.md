#### Aim: To implement a RISC_V Disassembler.

1. The folder consists of the following:
    1. DisAssembler.py
    2. opt_dict.json
    3. input.txt

2. Replace the machine code that needs to be disassembled in input.txt

3. The opt_dict.json file contains the opcode and funct3 and funct7 values for all the instructions in RISC-V. It has already been linked with the python code, so no changes are needed for this file.

4. Open a terminal, and run <br />
```
python DisAssembler.py
```
In case this does not work, try running <br />
```
python3 DisAssembler.py
```
