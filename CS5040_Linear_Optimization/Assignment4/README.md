We have to implement the Simplex Algorithm given the following assumptions:
1. Rank of A is $n$ 


The input is CSV file with $m+1$ rows and $n+1$ columns. 
1. The first row excluding the last element is the cost vector $c$ of length $n$
2. The last column excluding the top element is the constraint vector $b$ of length $m$
3. Rows second to $m+1$ and column one to $n$ is the matrix A of size $m\times n$

Run the following commands: <br /> 
```
cd Assignment4
python3 Assignment4.py
```
